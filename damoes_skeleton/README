## How damoes_skeleton Works (Core Strategy)

damoes_skeleton continuously monitors the XAUUSD chart on the 1-minute timeframe. The core strategy includes:

1. Automated Swing Detection: The bot constantly analyzes candle patterns to identify fractal formations, marking swing highs (peaks) and swing lows (troughs).

2. Spread Filter: Before opening any position, the bot checks the current spread conditions. If the spread exceeds a predefined limit, the bot will delay entry to protect profitability.

3. Entry Strategy:

    - BUY: When a detected swing low forms, the bot seeks opportunities to open a buy position.

    - SELL: When a detected swing high forms, the bot seeks opportunities to open a sell position.

4. Lot Size & Profit Target: Each position is opened with a lot volume of 0.03 and is targeted for a fixed profit of IDR 5,000.

5. Active Position Management: The bot manages up to 8 open positions concurrently (maximum 4 buys and 4 sells), ensuring diversification and adaptation to changing market conditions.

6. No Explicit Stop-Loss: This bot does not utilize an explicit stop-loss. Its risk management strategy relies on position management and active monitoring, requiring user awareness and oversight.
